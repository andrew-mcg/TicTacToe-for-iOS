This is a two player only Tic-Tac-Toe iOS game written in Swift 1.2 on XCode 6.3.2. 

This project mostly follows Lecture 65 of Rob Percival's Udemy Course, The Complete iOS8 and Swift Course: Learn by Building 15 Real World Apps. 

Additional features that I’ve included are:
 - nicer graphics :-)
 - sounds
 - winning line highlighted
 - detects drawn game

This project is my first to be committed to GitHub and one of my early efforts at learning Swift code.

I wanted to use an array of UIImageViews for the winning lines display but didn’t have early success and settled on a switch…case statement instead.

The project is also fixed for 4” screen in portrait mode. I wasn’t happy that I’d learnt enough about Auto Layout and Size Classes to be able to implement them properly. At this early stage I’m probably more focused to learning the fundamentals of Swift but I appreciate that design and presentation need solid representation too. That will evolve in subsequent versions hopefully.
